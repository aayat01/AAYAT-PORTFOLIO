         <p class="paragraph">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was also known as Mahatma, 
            "Great Soul" Gandhi, was a hero, as well as a political and 
            spiritual leader of India. He was of the Hindu faith, of which
             I am too. Mohandas brought India to independence by using 
             non-violent resistance. He thought that there was injustice 
             being served to the Indians, especially to the immigrants by 
             the South Africans. Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, 
             Kathiawar, now known as Gujarat. Gandhi passed away at the age 
             of 78 on January 30, 1948. Mahatma Gandhi was brought up in India 
             near Rajkot, where he did most of his studies. In 1888, Gandhi 
             went to London, leaving his wife and son behind, to pursue his 
             degree in law. Later in 1893, Gandhi went to South Africa to 
             work and found that there was a lot of prejudice towards Indians.
              That was the reason Gandhi began protesting and eventually 
              he became an inspiring hero for millions. The three main qualities that define Gandhi 
            as a hero are his strong leadership, simplicity and bravery.</p>

        <h1 id="container">Education of Mahatama Gandhi</h1><hr>

        <div id="container">
          <p class="paragraph">Mahatma Gandhi's education was a major factor in his development into one of the 
            finest persons in history. Although he attended a primary school in Porbandar and received awards 
            
            and scholarships there, his approach to his education was ordinary. Gandhi joined Samaldas College 
            in Bhavnagar after passing his matriculation exams at the University of Bombay in 1887.


Gandhiji's father insisted he become a lawyer even though he intended to be a docto.  During those days, 
England was the centre of knowledge, and he had to leave Smaladas College to pursue his father's desire. 
He was adamant about travelling to England despite his mother's objections and his limited financial resources. </p>

        <h1 id="container">Mahatma Gandhi During His Youth</h1><hr>
        <div id="container">
          <p class="paragraph">Gandhi was the youngest child of his father's fourth wife.
             Mohandas Karamchand  Gandhi was the dewan Chief Minister of Porbandar, 
             the then capital of a small municipality in western India (now Gujarat state) under the British constituency.


           Gandhi's mother, Putlibai, was a pious religious woman.Mohandas grew up in Vaishnavism,
           a practice followed by the worship of the Hindu god Vishnu, along with a strong presence of Jainism, 
           which has a strong sense of non-violence.Therefore, he took up the practice of Ahimsa (non-violence towards all living beings), 
           fasting for self-purification, vegetarianism, and mutual tolerance between the sanctions of various castes and colours.


           His adolescence was probably no stormier than most children of his age and class. 
          Not until the age of 18 had Gandhi read a single newspaper. Neither as a budding barrister in India nor
          as a student in England nor had he shown much interest in politics. Indeed, he was overwhelmed by
         terrifying stage fright each time he stood up to read a speech at a social gathering or to defend a client in court.


       In London, Gandhiji's vegetarianism missionary was a noteworthy occurrence. He became a member of the 
       executive committee in joined the London Vegetarian Society. He also participated in several conferences
        and published papers in its journal. Gandhi met prominent Socialists, Fabians, and Theosophists like Edward Carpenter, 
         George Bernard Shaw, and Annie Besant while dining at vegetarian restaurants in England.</p>
